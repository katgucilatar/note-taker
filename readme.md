## Description
This Note Taker app was created for an assignment by UNC Coding Bootcamp. This app utilizes Express to create requests allowing for the user to create their own personal to-do list.

View this app deployed on Heroku here:


## Installation
In order to download this code from the repository, one must have a software such as VS Code or one that's similar. Along with VS Code, it is necessary to download Node.JS as many components of this code such as Express can only be access through Node.JS. 

Upon installing Node.JS, the user must also install Express and UUID in the terminal.
To install Express, first enter this in the terminal to create a JSON package: npm init -y 
After package is created, install Express by entering this in the terminal: npm i express

## Tests
Upon installing everything, this app will work once connected to the PORT in which it is locally hosted. To do so, simply type in "node server.js" in the terminal in which the PORT will be started.

The user can then open the PORT in the browser and in this project specifically, the URL in the browser will be "localhost:3000" in which the user can press the "Get Started" button on the homepage to begin entering their notes.

The user can then enter their Note Title and Note Text on the right hand side and upon clicking the save button on the top right, the user's note is now saved on the left-hand side!

## Usage
Anyone may use this app to create a to-do list for themselves. This app is very convenient and multi-functional for many whether it be students, parents, or even an average person wanting to make a grocery list.
